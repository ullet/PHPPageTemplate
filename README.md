----------

Dug this old code out of the archive. This is a object-oriented PHP page template system that I created for a now defunct website. It started over a decade ago and evolved slowly, in bursts, over three years, gaining complexity and migrating from PHP 4 to 5. It is loosely based on ASP.NET pages and user controls.

Mostly this exists because (1) it got tedious updating static HTML pages, (2) I wanted to learn PHP, and (3) I liked doing things the hard way; no off-the-shelve solution for me, even if it was free.
It more or less did the job it was created for, but I won't claim it was ever put under any real strain. The website it was used on was a personal website with very little traffic (it got more visits from Google's crawl bots than any human).

I've excavated it now mostly out of curiosity, and perhaps as a feeble attempt to justify putting PHP on my CV. I don't recommend using it for anything.
